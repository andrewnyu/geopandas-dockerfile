# geopandas-dockerfile
Dockerfile that installs Geopandas on Python 3.8 with spatial join working

Background: I recently wanted to find a simple way to get geopandas spatial join running on a Docker container and found that existing online resources did not work out of the box. 

<br>

I created this Dockerfile to help streamline the creation of my web application which uses geopandas spatial join on the backend. Hope this is helpful and let me know your thoughts and comments.
